36~@~NIH~@~Whole body analysis of human T cells in lymphoid and mucosal. TCs from blood, spleen, peripheral and tissue-draining lymph nodes, lung, small and large intestines from healthy donors. Composition of naive, memory and terminal effector CD4 and CD8 subsets in blood, lymphoid and mucosal tissues is intrinsic to the tissue site and similar between donors. Compartmentalization of human TCs in tissues throughout the body depends on multiple mechanisms including the extent of replication, expression of specific TC receptors (TCR), and tissue-specific factors. 1. role of replication and turnover in compartmentalization of TC subsets; 2. Assess how TCR diversity and clonality is related to compartmentalization of TC subsets in sites using sequencing approaches, are sites are enriched for specific TC clones or contain limited TCR diversity compared to blood; 3. Define the tissue-specific influences on TCs in circulating compared to lymphoid and mucosal sites through transcriptome analysis~@~2019-12-31 00:00:00~@~https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-413.html~@~NIAID Investigator Initiated Program Project Applications (P01) PAR-16-413, PAR-13-254~@~\N~@~2014-01-01 00:00:00~@@~
44~@~NIH~@~Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) to characterize human immune responses/mechanisms elicited by vaccinations, adjuvants or natural infection by capitalizing on recent advances in immune profiling technologies. Measure the diversity and commonalities of human immune responses under a variety of conditions using high-throughput systems biology approaches coupled with detailed clinical phenotyping in well-characterized human cohorts. An additional goal of this program is to advance research by promoting rapid public access to HIPC-supported data and results through public portals such as ImmPort and ImmuneSpace, as well as the development of new methods for data integration, analysis, presentation, and visualization to further research and development in this field.
