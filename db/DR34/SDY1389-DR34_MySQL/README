# Instruction for Creating and Loading the Study database into MySQL
#========================================================================
These instructions assume you want to create the tables in a database
named "shared_data", but you can choose your own name. One example would be
to create the database "SDY1" to load in the SDY1 study, etc.

1) Create empty database, e.g., "shared_data". Login into mysql as root
   (or a user with sufficient privileges to accomplish the steps below
   and run the following commands:

   create database shared_data CHARACTER SET utf8;

2) Create the tables, indexes and foreign keys. The scripts require
   4 paramaters to be specified: Host, User, Password and Database

   cd to the scripts directory.

   Step 1: Create the lookup tables.

           ./createLkSchema.sh Host User Password Database

   Step 2: Create the research/study/clincal tables.

           ./createResearchSchema.sh Host User Password Database


3) Load the data. The scripts require 4 parameters to be specified:
   Host, User, Password and Database

   cd to the scripts directory.

   Step 1: Load the data for the lookup tables.

           ./loadLkData.sh Host User Password Database

   Step 2: Load in the research/study/clinical tables

           ./loadResearchData.sh Host User Password Database

   Step 3: Optional: Create the foreign keys
           This step may produce a couple of error messages for a couple
           of studies. We are in the process of fixing the primary data,
           for these isolated cases.

           ./createForeignKeys.sh Host User Password Database
