Overall, CMV-specific T cells were maintained in distinct distribution patterns, either predominant in blood, bone marrow (BM) and lung, or lymph nodes (LN) with the frequency and function in blood distinct from tissues. Together, our results reveal tissue T cell reservoirs for CMV control, with global effects on T cell homeostasis over the human lifespan.~@~10.21430/M3MIPLU7ZU~@~FCS data classifying T cells~@~Female, Male~@~CMV-specific T cells in peripheral tissues have varied differentiation, maintenance, and function, as a function of individual, tissue site, and viral persistence~@~2017-06-16 00:00:00~@~DR22~@~\N~@~2019-06-19 00:00:00~@~DR31~@~  70.00~@~  21.00~@~Characterize tissue CMV-specific CD8 T-cell and polyclonal T cell phenotypes~@~Tissue reservoirs of anti-viral T cell immunity in persistent human CMV infection~@~NIAID, NIA, NCRR~@~20~@~3670~@@~
